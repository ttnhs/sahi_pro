<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Robot bridge comes bundled with Sahi. Following must be completed before you can invoke test cases using the bridge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python must be installed on the machine (This version was tested with v2.7 of Python). If you don't have Python already installed, grab a copy from <a href="http://www.python.org/getit/">Python Website</a></li>
<li>Robot framework must be installed and available in systems PATH variable. Generally you need to add the scripts folder of Python to your PATH variable. This will insure that we have pybot available for script execution.</li>
<li>Add your_sahi_home/plugins/robot to your PYTHONPATH</li>
<p>A batch file called runRobotTest.bat is present within the plugins/robot folder which can be used to test the correct working of the bridge using a ready made script in Sahi.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You need to change the path of scripts folder in your resource.txt file to match your scripts folder path.</p>
