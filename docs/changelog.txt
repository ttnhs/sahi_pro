---------------
Sahi Pro V6.0.1 released.

This is a bugfix release

* Bugfixes
	Scripts were running slower because Sahi was waiting for uninitiated XmlHttpRequest objects also. Fixed
	Highlighting matching brackets in Editor and Controller was broken. Fixed
	URL encoding query parameters in REST APIs
	Editor was saving files with \n as line separator. Fixed to use the file's original line ending.
	After the execution on first node was aborted, when scripts were re-executed on another node, offline logs were not getting generated. Fixed.
	When a node goes offline, master would sometimes hang waiting for a response and retry would never be invoked. Fixed.
	windowAction APIs which were experimental in Mac, are temporarily disabled.
	When _setStrictVisibilityCheck is true, elements inside frames were returning false for _isVisible. Fixed.
	Object Repository is renamed to Accessor Repository to better convey its usage and meaning. File endings will now default to _AR.sah. Existing _OR.sah will continue to work.
	Added props parameter in _assertSnapShot API which allows specifying additional attributes like delay, trim, image type etc.
	Property java.ntlm.transparent_authentication.enabled in sahi.properties was doing the opposite. Fixed.
	In a data driven suite, if the header column size and row column size did not match, there were failures on a single machine as well as distributed run. Fixed.
	In a distributed run with a data driven suite, if a row had a blank value in an intermediate column, the script execution would fail and the run would go into an infinite loop. Fixed.
	After the execution on first node was aborted, when scripts were re-executed on another node, offline logs were not getting generated. Fixed.
	When a node goes offline, master would sometimes hang waiting for a response and retry would never be invoked. Fixed.
	Fix to sync the scripts to the correct machine in case of Distributed Run with a different master
	In a distributed run, if the nodes are unavailable (browser is not supported or Master cannot communicate with the node), the run would never terminate. Fixed.
	Trimming contents in Import CSV in Editor. The untrimmed spaces was causing scenarios to fail. Fixed.
	Fixed UI issues in ddcsv editor - Copy paste, editing etc. were broken
	Optimizing getAssociatedLabel. Look only in current window object and only upto 8 parents. Was using too much CPU for pages with lots of nested iframes and containing lots of elements.
	In some cases, _takePageScreenShot showed double images when the page size was less than the browser window size. Fixed
	_assertEqualImages and _compareImages was failing when any of the file paths had a space in them. Fixed.
	Running an empty suite returns success now
	Optimized fetching of suites list in Logs
	Incorrect information in junit reports removed
	dload.bat would not terminate after running the load tests. Fixed.
	Documentation added for APIs _startHarLogging and _stopHarLogging.
	Load testing documentation updated
	When testing an ANT target generated from [icode]Editor > Playback > Create Ant Target[/icode], in case of a Retry, the Retry status was not considered as the final status. Fixed.
	Dload ANT target has been fixed

* Features
	_mouseOverNative added for native mouse events
	subjectRepeatCount can be passed to dload. subject.sah will be run that many times at each load level. This helps average out any abnormal behaviour during that moment of execution.
